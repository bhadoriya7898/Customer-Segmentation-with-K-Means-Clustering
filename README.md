Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering
This repository contains code for customer segmentation using K-Means clustering, aiming to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchase behavior.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains customer data relevant to customer segmentation. It includes features such as gender, age, annual income, and spending score. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle.

You can access the dataset on Kaggle via the following link: Customer Segmentation Dataset

Project Overview
The project involves the following steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset by exploring its features and distributions.
Data Preprocessing: Preparing the data for clustering by selecting relevant features and standardizing them.
Determining Optimal Number of Clusters: Using the Elbow Method to select the optimal number of clusters for K-Means.
Model Building: Implementing K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct clusters.
Visualization: Visualizing the clusters to interpret the results and gain insights into customer segments.
Evaluation: Assessing the clustering performance using Silhouette Score.
Files
customer_segmentation.py: Python script containing the code for EDA, data preprocessing, model building, visualization, and evaluation.
customer_data.csv: CSV file containing the customer data.
